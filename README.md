# file-conversion
TLDR: learning how to work w/ images, sound files, videos!

## Motivation
I found myself bored during the winter break of my senior year and had been wanting to understand how different file formats work! My goal is to be able to have sufficient understanding of different file formats, e.g. PNG and JPEG, to convert between different formats.
